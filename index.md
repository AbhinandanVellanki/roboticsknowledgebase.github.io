## Welcome to the Robotics Wiki

### Why a wiki for robotics?
**The Robotics Wiki** exists to advance knowledge in the robotics discipline.  

As practitioners, we believe that we are pioneering a new field.
Robots are inherently complex and require knowledge across numerous disciplines. This know-how takes time to develop.

Resources that exist are specialized and academic in focus. These frequently lack implementation details or instructions on applying the information provided.  These create a high-barrier of entry into the field.

To accelerate the development of both projects and individual skills, we created a knowledge base to share our knowledge, best practices, and lessons learned so that others may succeed.

**The Robotics Wiki** is that knowledge base. Here, you will find guidance on the full spectrum of our field.

### Where should I start?

### How can I contribute?


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/smbryan/smbryan.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
