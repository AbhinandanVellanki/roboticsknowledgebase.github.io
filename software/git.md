Git is a distributed revision control and source code management system with an emphasis on speed. Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version tracking capabilities, and is not dependent on network access or a central server.
Git is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU GPLv2. wikipedia
