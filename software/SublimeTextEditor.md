Other tidbits:

    You can select multiple spots to type something by holding control and then left clicking where you want to type and it will type the same thing at each place
    Highlighting lines and pressing Tab will indent all of the highlighted lines. Holding Shift and then pressing Tab will unindent.
    Holding Control and pressing h brings up the Replace Window. Put what you want to replace in the "Find What:" box, and then what you would like to replace it with in the "Replace With:" box. You can also highlight lines and then click the box directly to the left of the "Find What:" box and it will only look inside of the highlighted lines to find what you're looking for as well as only replace in that highlighted section when "Replace All" is clicked.
    In the View tab, if you go to Side Bar -> Show Side Bar, it will open a list of the open files on the left hand side of the window. This makes it much easier to navigate files when you have many open at once.
    The minimap can be toggled on and off at View -> Hide/Show Minimap
    If you hover over the line numbers on the left side of the window, an arrow will show up if you can fold the code. This can be useful to hide code you aren't currently looking at to focus on one snippet at a time.
    In the Preferences tab, you can change the color scheme of your code by going to the Color Scheme box. There are also ways to make your own schemes, and plenty of other themes you can download if you want.
    Tab width and Code Interpreter can be changed in the bottom left hand corner of the window of the current code file.
