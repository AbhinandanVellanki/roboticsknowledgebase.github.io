The *Robotics Knowledgebase* is the Wiki for Robot Builders. We document and share application details left out of textbooks and academic papers. 

## Contributing to the Robotics Wiki

To submit an original article follow these steps:
1. [Fork](https://github.com/RoboticsKnowledgebase/roboticsknowledgebase.github.io#fork-destination-box) this repository.
2. Locate the appropriate directory for your submission in `/wiki`
3. Copy `_templates/template.md` into the directory.
4. Write your article. We recommend the following options:
  - Connect [Prose.io](http://prose.io/) to your Github account and write from your browser.
  - Clone the respository to your device and use the [Atom editor](https://atom.io/). We recommend the [Markdown-Writer](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-writer) and [Markdown-Image-Helper](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-image-helper) packages.
5. Rename `template.md` to the subject of your article. The new name should be lowercase, have hyphens for spaces, and end with `.md` (`this-is-an-example.md`)
6. Add a link to your article to `_data/navigation.yml` under the `wiki` heading.
  - Do not modify the `main` or `docs` lists.
7. Submit a pull request to the Robotics Knowledgebase.
  - If your working from your device, don't forget to add, commit, and push your changes first.
8. View your page after the editors accept your submission.

If you spot a mistake (or think that you have an improvement to an article), [create an issue](https://github.com/RoboticsKnowledgebase/roboticsknowledgebase.github.io/issues) to discuss your recommended changes.
