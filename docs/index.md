This page contains guidance on how to contribute to the Robotics Knowledgebase.

## Guiding Principles
1. The Robotics Knowledgebase is application focused.
  - It strives to contain information and references useful to the building of robotic systems.
2. The Robotics Knowledgebase is written from a neutral point of view.
  - We seek to illuminate the complex and evolving world of robotics.
  - We avoid advocacy and personal experiences, interpretations, and opinions.
  - We reference sources where possible. As pioneers in a new field, we understand this isn't always possible, but will always give credit where it is due.
3. The Robotics Knowledgebase covers the full scope of robotics
  - The scope of the wiki encompasses topics such as System Design Project Management in addition to the core cannon of robotics research.
