Traffic modelling is a hot topic in the field of autonomous cars currently. Here you will find a list of open datasets which can be used as source for building a traffic model. The list will include data captured from a variety of sources as listed below:
- UAV/Drones
- Traffic Camera 
- Autonomous Cars

> This is not a list of datasets for learning-to-drive. This list is more focused towards dataset which provide global perspective of the traffic scenarios, rather than ego-vehicle perspective. Though few ego-vehicle datasets can be used for traffic modelling as well.

Each dataset is scored based upon several parameters crucial for learning behavior and interactions between vehicles in a recorded scenario.
