title: Setup your GPU Enabled System for Computer Vision and Deep Learning
---

This tutorial will help you setup your Ubuntu (16/17/18) system with a NVIDIA GPU including installing the Drivers, CUDA, cuDNN, and TensorRT libraries. Tutorial also covers on how to build OpenCV from source and installing Deep Learning Frameworks such as TensorFlow (Source Build), PyTorch, Darknet for YOLO, Theano, and Keras. The tutorial is actively maintained at [https://github.com/heethesh/Computer-Vision-and-Deep-Learning-Setup/](https://github.com/heethesh/Computer-Vision-and-Deep-Learning-Setup/) and the contents can be easily accessed below.
